# Keeb Geek Ipsum

A program that generates filler paragraphs like lorem ipsum, except the text is related to sayings that I've seen and heard in the mechanical keyboard community.

## Details

Text and keyboard image made myself.

## Running App Locally

Use command `node app.js` in terminal, this uses Express/Node as a web server. Then access the program on your browser at **localhost:3000**.

## Deployment

Keeb Geek Ipsum is hosted with Heroku [here](https://rugged-hawaii-volcanoes-99597.herokuapp.com/).

## Credits

- Used this [Stranger Ipsum](https://github.com/robertcoopercode/stranger-ipsum/tree/v1.0.1#readme) for assistance with generating paragraphs and setting up web server.
